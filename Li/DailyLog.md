<br />

### June 23, 2021 (Day 17)
Updates:
* Attended seminar on 'Connecting to a Career Through LinkedIn' by Harrell Townsend.
* Met with Nicole for one-on-one 'office hours,' since I felt very lost on project. We discussed the ROI/HoughP notebook. She helped me by clarifying what should be done next. I will be furthering my ROI model on images with varying features (i.e. snowing, cloudy, sunny, etc...), essentially testing different parameters and building the training set for the ML algorithm. CNN can be used later for determining snow cover. 
* TLDR: We will be using ML rather than manual image labeling. DL can be easily applied later for snow detection.
* The tentative project outline:
    (1) Input Images
    (2) ML algorithm classifies images. The classification identifies parameters for edge detection/LSD.
    (3) Run appropriate LSD program to identify lines (i.e. the three poles).
    (4) TBD: probably run CNN
* Worked on implementing createFastLineDetector() into the ROI/HoughP JN. The initial line detections have been very weak. 
* Sources:
    (1) [Fast line detector](https://docs.opencv.org/4.5.2/df/ded/group__ximgproc__fast__line__detector.html). 
    (2) [How to use OpenCV4's FastLineDetector in Python 3?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57017927/how-to-use-opencv4s-fastlinedetector-in-python-3). 
    (3) [A new fast line detection algorithm](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1627457)
* Created database with images with varing features. Identified potential features: grass, snow, day, night, light, season, time.
* Meeting with Student Connects Group. Presented 1-2 minute introduction to current research.
 
To Do:
* Continue studying and working on OpenCV tutorials and project.

<br />

### June 24, 2021 (Day 18)
Updates:
* Meeting with Computer Vision Group. Discussed progress for this week.
* Tinkered with ways to improve createFastLineDetector() for detection of poles. The middle pole is the only one with 'perfect' line detection, mainly because it is facing towards the camera. The left and right poles are at an angle, so only the lines closest to the camera can be detected. 
* Found someone asking a similar question on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57080937/increase-accuracy-of-detecting-lines-using-opencv). The recommended procedure is (1) Convert image to grayscale, (2) Apply a sharpening kernel (3) Threshold image, (4) Perform morphological operations to smooth/filter image. Unfortunately, this did not perform as well on the snow images as it did on their examples. The sharpening created more noise from the snow.
* Tried blurring methods as suggested by this [source](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2021/04/28/opencv-smoothing-and-blurring/). The results improved significantly as background noises were reduced. This enabled the lines to be detected on the poles. Spent the rest of the time optimizing this. 

To Do:
* Continue studying and working on OpenCV tutorials and project.

<br />

### June 25, 2021 (Day 19)
Updates:
* Continued optimizing the program. Results can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1sPCrQWO7bUhgc-LEFQDKvdJ1INRbq5lp?usp=sharing) comparing different results with and without blurring. 
* Finalized the Jupyter Notebook. This can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1sPCrQWO7bUhgc-LEFQDKvdJ1INRbq5lp?usp=sharing). 
* Created a separate Python program which can be ran quickly. I created fixed ROI regions, so it can be consistent for every image. This can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1sPCrQWO7bUhgc-LEFQDKvdJ1INRbq5lp?usp=sharing). The program is capable of detecting lines for a separate image with similar lighting and snow conditions. 
* Looked into feature extraction methods for images. One feature that can be extracted is color. That can be useful for identifying parameters. 
* Source: [Color Identification using KMeans and OpenCV](https://www.kaggle.com/shubhanshugupta/color-identification-using-kmeans-and-opencv)

To Do:
* Continue studying and working on OpenCV tutorials and project.

## Week 5 

<br />


### June 28, 2021 (Day 20)
Updates:
* Organized files, images, and programs in desktop and Drive. Updated links on Logs. 
* Worked with K-means algorithm from Friday to detect dominant color for images. The JN can be found [](). The results show that images with similar dominant hue were detected by the first line detection program created. However, changes in weather or lighting may affect the line detections, even with similar dominant hue. Images with different hue dominant could not have lines detected. The JN can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10WqOMgO-E2BctzvELRWiE6GrZ9vTzP2F?usp=sharing).
* I uploaded the results onto a PowerPoint, which can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10WqOMgO-E2BctzvELRWiE6GrZ9vTzP2F?usp=sharing). This will be presented in tomorrow's CV meeting.

To Do:
* Continue studying and working on OpenCV tutorials and project.

<br />

### June 29, 2021 (Day 21)

Updates:
* Meeting with Computer Vision Group. Discussed results found yesterday and improvements to be made for extracting features from images. Dividing the image into regions and using K-means may be one way to improve model.
* Looked into 'chunking.' Colin sent me a [JN](https://github.com/waggle-sensor/anomaly-detection/blob/main/.ipynb_checkpoints/Anomaly%20Detection%20(PCA)-checkpoint.ipynb) on something he worked on with chunking/compression/PCA.
* Image Chunking Sources:
    (1) [How do you split a list into evenly sized chunks?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/312443/how-do-you-split-a-list-into-evenly-sized-chunks)
    (2) [Image Processing](https://examples.dask.org/applications/image-processing.html)
    (3) [How to split image into small blocks, process on them and then join all the blocks together again?](https://answers.opencv.org/question/173852/how-to-split-image-into-small-blocks-process-on-them-and-then-join-all-the-blocks-together-again/)
    (4) [Efficiently splitting an image into tiles in Python using NumPy](https://towardsdatascience.com/efficiently-splitting-an-image-into-tiles-in-python-using-numpy-d1bf0dd7b6f7)

To Do:
* Continue studying and working on OpenCV tutorials and project.

<br />

### June 30, 2021 (Day 22)

Updates:
* Attended seminar on 'Pathway to a Science Career Panel Seminar' by Dr. Kevin Brown.
* Decided to test out ROIs for feature extractions before diving deeper into image chunking. The dominant color from each ROI will be extracted as a feature. 
* Looked into ways to convert RGB data to usable categorical data. Found a way to convert RGB to labels by finding the closest color using Webcolors Python package. [Source](https://predictivehacks.com/how-to-use-rgb-codes-as-features-in-a-machine-learning-algorithm/).
* Incorporated Webcolors function into the RGB Color/Feature Extraction program. 

To Do:
* Continue studying and working on OpenCV tutorials and project.
* Find out how to save/read multiple images from a file onto Python.

### July 1, 2021 (Day 23)

Updates:
* Found a way to easily load all images from a folder into a list using Glob Package. This will make the process of extracting features from multiple images easier and faster. [Source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30230592/loading-all-images-using-imread-from-a-given-folder).
* Incorporated Glob function and Pandas into the RGB Color/Feature Extraction program. 
* Acquired data from a smaller image dataset before moving to a larger image dataset (50 photos). The JN and the CSV file containing the extracted color labels for the larger dataset can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10YVwwTP2-Gk79IVNf2VXBT-IOyueCAaH?usp=sharing). 
* From the results, we can see that images containing similar color labels (through closest distance measure) exhibit similar lighting and weather. However, in some instances, two photos can have very similar color labels but drastically different weather and lighting. For instance, NEON.D19.HEAL.DP1.00042_2017_09_30_114505.jpg contains the labels 'dimgray', 'slategray', and 'dimgray.' There is snow on the ground and partly cloudy in the image. On the otherhand, NEON.D19.HEAL.DP1.00042_2017_09_01_060006.jpg contains the labels 'dimgray', 'gray', and 'dimgray.' There is grass and no snow in the photo. 
* Because of this result, I decided that extracting colors from the ROIs are not enough. Thus, I decided to split the images into 4x4 chunks, extracting the color from each chunk. The JN and the CSV file containing the extracted color labels can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10YVwwTP2-Gk79IVNf2VXBT-IOyueCAaH?usp=sharing). 

To Do:
* Continue studying and working on OpenCV tutorials and project.
* Analyze the larger dataset. Find out how to classify data.
