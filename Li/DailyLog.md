<br />

### June 23, 2021 (Day 17)
Updates:
* Attended seminar on 'Connecting to a Career Through LinkedIn' by Harrell Townsend.
* Met with Nicole for one-on-one 'office hours,' since I felt very lost on project. We discussed the ROI/HoughP notebook. She helped me by clarifying what should be done next. I will be furthering my ROI model on images with varying features (i.e. snowing, cloudy, sunny, etc...), essentially testing different parameters and building the training set for the ML algorithm. CNN can be used later for determining snow cover. 
* TLDR: We will be using ML rather than manual image labeling. DL can be easily applied later for snow detection.
* The tentative project outline:
    (1) Input Images
    (2) ML algorithm classifies images. The classification identifies parameters for edge detection/LSD.
    (3) Run appropriate LSD program to identify lines (i.e. the three poles).
    (4) TBD: probably run CNN
* Worked on implementing createFastLineDetector() into the ROI/HoughP JN. The initial line detections have been very weak. 
* Sources:
    (1) [Fast line detector](https://docs.opencv.org/4.5.2/df/ded/group__ximgproc__fast__line__detector.html). 
    (2) [How to use OpenCV4's FastLineDetector in Python 3?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57017927/how-to-use-opencv4s-fastlinedetector-in-python-3). 
    (3) [A new fast line detection algorithm](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1627457)
* Created database with images with varing features. Identified potential features: grass, snow, day, night, light, season, time.
* Meeting with Student Connects Group. Presented 1-2 minute introduction to current research.
 
To Do:
* Continue studying and working on OpenCV tutorials and project.

<br />

### June 24, 2021 (Day 18)
Updates:
* Meeting with Computer Vision Group. Discussed progress for this week.
* Tinkered with ways to improve createFastLineDetector() for detection of poles. The middle pole is the only one with 'perfect' line detection, mainly because it is facing towards the camera. The left and right poles are at an angle, so only the lines closest to the camera can be detected. 
* Found someone asking a similar question on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57080937/increase-accuracy-of-detecting-lines-using-opencv). The recommended procedure is (1) Convert image to grayscale, (2) Apply a sharpening kernel (3) Threshold image, (4) Perform morphological operations to smooth/filter image. Unfortunately, this did not perform as well on the snow images as it did on their examples. The sharpening created more noise from the snow.
* Tried blurring methods as suggested by this [source](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2021/04/28/opencv-smoothing-and-blurring/). The results improved significantly as background noises were reduced. This enabled the lines to be detected on the poles. Spent the rest of the time optimizing this. 

To Do:
* Continue studying and working on OpenCV tutorials and project.

<br />

### June 25, 2021 (Day 19)
Updates:
* Continued optimizing the program. Results can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1sPCrQWO7bUhgc-LEFQDKvdJ1INRbq5lp?usp=sharing) comparing different results with and without blurring. 
* Finalized the Jupyter Notebook. This can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1sPCrQWO7bUhgc-LEFQDKvdJ1INRbq5lp?usp=sharing). 
* Created a separate Python program which can be ran quickly. I created fixed ROI regions, so it can be consistent for every image. This can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1sPCrQWO7bUhgc-LEFQDKvdJ1INRbq5lp?usp=sharing). The program is capable of detecting lines for a separate image with similar lighting and snow conditions. 
* Looked into feature extraction methods for images. One feature that can be extracted is color. That can be useful for identifying parameters.

## Week 5 

<br />


### June 28, 2021 (Day 20)
Updates:
* Organized files, images, and programs in desktop and Drive. Updated links on Logs. 
* Worked with K-means algorithm from Friday to detect dominant color for images. The JN can be found [](). The results show that images with similar dominant hue were detected by the first line detection program created. However, changes in weather or lighting may affect the line detections, even with similar dominant hue. Images with different hue dominant could not have lines detected. The JN can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10WqOMgO-E2BctzvELRWiE6GrZ9vTzP2F?usp=sharing).
* I uploaded the results onto a PowerPoint, which can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10WqOMgO-E2BctzvELRWiE6GrZ9vTzP2F?usp=sharing). This will be presented in tomorrow's CV meeting.

To Do:

<br />

### June 29, 2021 (Day 21)

Updates:
* Meeting with Computer Vision Group. Discussed results found yesterday and improvements to be made for extracting features from images. Dividing the image into regions and using K-means may be one way to improve model.
* Looked into 'chunking.' Colin sent me a [JN](https://github.com/waggle-sensor/anomaly-detection/blob/main/.ipynb_checkpoints/Anomaly%20Detection%20(PCA)-checkpoint.ipynb) on something he worked on with chunking/compression/PCA.
* Image Chunking Sources:

To Do:
* Continue studying and working on OpenCV tutorials and project.

<br />

### June 30, 2021 (Day 22)

Updates:
* Attended seminar on 'Pathway to a Science Career Panel Seminar' by Dr. Kevin Brown.
* Decided to test out ROIs for feature extractions before diving deeper into image chunking. The dominant color from each ROI will be extracted as a feature. 
* Looked into ways to convert RGB data to usable categorical data. Found a way to convert RGB to labels by finding the closest color using Webcolors Python package. [Source](https://predictivehacks.com/how-to-use-rgb-codes-as-features-in-a-machine-learning-algorithm/).
* Incorporated Webcolors function into the RGB Color/Feature Extraction program. 

To Do:
* Continue studying and working on OpenCV tutorials and project.
* Find out how to save/read multiple images from a file onto Python.

### July 1, 2021 (Day 23)

Updates:
* Meeting with larger CV group. Discussed progress for this week.
* Found a way to easily load all images from a folder into a list using Glob Package. This will make the process of extracting features from multiple images easier and faster. [Source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30230592/loading-all-images-using-imread-from-a-given-folder).
* Incorporated Glob function and Pandas into the RGB Color/Feature Extraction program. 
* Acquired data from a smaller image dataset before moving to a larger image dataset (50 photos). The JN and the CSV file containing the extracted color labels for the larger dataset can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10YVwwTP2-Gk79IVNf2VXBT-IOyueCAaH?usp=sharing). 
* From the results, we can see that images containing similar color labels (through closest distance measure) exhibit similar lighting and weather. However, in some instances, two photos can have very similar color labels but drastically different weather and lighting. For instance, NEON.D19.HEAL.DP1.00042_2017_09_30_114505.jpg contains the labels 'dimgray', 'slategray', and 'dimgray.' There is snow on the ground and partly cloudy in the image. On the otherhand, NEON.D19.HEAL.DP1.00042_2017_09_01_060006.jpg contains the labels 'dimgray', 'gray', and 'dimgray.' There is grass and no snow in the photo. 
* Because of this result, I decided that extracting colors from the ROIs are not enough. Thus, I decided to split the images into 4x4 chunks, extracting the color from each chunk. The JN and the CSV file containing the extracted color labels can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10YVwwTP2-Gk79IVNf2VXBT-IOyueCAaH?usp=sharing). 

To Do:
* Continue studying and working on OpenCV tutorials and project.
* Analyze the larger dataset. Find out how to classify data.

### July 2, 2021 (Day 24)

Updates:
* Still followed and maintained the idea that images with similar weather/lighting conditions will possess similar color labels. Through analyzing the datasets, I found the dataset containing only ROIs to be more suceptible to errors, primarily with the color gray. Several images in September possess the dominant colors for the ROIs to be gray, even when there is no snow present. This is unfavorable for the classification algorithm.
* The data set with chunked data is obviously more robust as greater amount of features was gathered from all over the image: the dominant color labels are more diverse. Images with no snow contain color labels only present when there is no snow. Yet, the only downside is that this can be computationally expensive to generate and run models on. 
* Separated the images visually by perceived color (manually by eye) into different folders. This will aid in finding out similarities in color labels among images in the same folder (which will later help in developing the right program to run on these images to find lines). This can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LqoVygZs-KuCaWYdyFFLKL7oy7XkA-yT?usp=sharing).
* Created and finished presentation of results for Tuesday, which can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JtmTLseZsukvcth7h0NPWmNGSchqn8Y8?usp=sharing).

To Do:
* Continue studying and working on OpenCV tutorials and project.

<br />

## Week 6 

<br />

### July 6, 2021 (Day 25)
Updates:
* Meeting with Computer Vision Group. Presented results and discussed alternative methods to the ROI and Chunking methods. One suggestion would be to extract the color labels only for the bottom four chunks in the 4x4 image. This method is robust since the bottom of images contain less noise and objects compared to the rest of the image. 
* Looked into the alternative. Decided that including the ROIs in the data would be also important since we would be detecting lines from those areas. The proposed optimized feature extraction algorithm would include seven areas in the image where color labels will be attained: the bottom four regions (4x4) and the three ROIs.
* The JN for the above described algorithm can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JtmTLseZsukvcth7h0NPWmNGSchqn8Y8?usp=sharing) along with the dataset corresponding to it. 
* Began developing and refining parameters for line detection of images resembling snow_test.jpg (i.e. images which are cloudy, contain snow, and predominantly contain dim gray labels). Images containing 'dim gray' label with no snow could be filtered out by their respective 'green' or 'brown' labels.  
* Ran into issues with making the line detection algorithms more robust to encompass numerous images. Looked into ways to improve accuracy of line detection, not specifically to createFastLineDetector() method. Reading the documents from OpenCV and examples of other users applying line detection techniques led me to look into adding a separate canny method, erode method, and dilate method. This made the lines detected by the createFastLineDetector() method more crisp and actually on the pole.
* Sources: 
    (1) [Fast line detector](https://docs.opencv.org/4.5.2/df/ded/group__ximgproc__fast__line__detector.html)

    (4) [How to detect lines in OpenCV?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45322630/how-to-detect-lines-in-opencv)
* Although the lines improved, the program was only applicable to one image. It would not apply to the other images despite several adjustments to the parameters.

To Do:
* Continue studying and working on OpenCV tutorials and project.

### July 7, 2021 (Day 26)
Updates:
* Attended seminar on 'Creating Effective Oral and Poster Presentations' by Dr. Bob Boomsma.
* Had one-on-one midpoint questionaire interview with Dr. Todd Munson.
* Read deeper into the [documents](https://docs.opencv.org/4.5.2/df/ded/group__ximgproc__fast__line__detector.html) for createFastLineDetector(), where I realized the errors in the parameters of the actual function. The parameters for createFastLineDetector() are:

    _length_threshold	10 - Segment shorter than this will be discarded
    _distance_threshold	1.41421356 - A point placed from a hypothesis line segment farther than this will be regarded as an outlier
    _canny_th1	50 - First threshold for hysteresis procedure in Canny()
    _canny_th2	50 - Second threshold for hysteresis procedure in Canny()
    _canny_aperture_size	3 - Aperturesize for the sobel operator in Canny(). If zero, Canny() is not applied and the input image is taken as an edge image.
    _do_merge	false - If true, incremental merging of segments will be performed

The original code for the createFastLineDetector (which can be found in the log for Day 19) contained the parameters '50, 100, 5, 5, 3, True.' These parameters were faulty, and obviously would lead to errors in future codes and for line detection for the following reasons:
    (1) The values for the first and second hysteresis are too low and inaccurate. The actual values can be determined through the canny track  bar program, which was initially mentioned and used in the log for Day 8. The canny trackbar program allows the user to select the best canny thresholds based on the canny output they see. The oriignal code can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1oUQMWgmphOGV-kxji74zP_XyLX4kVBNS). 
    (2) Since we implemented canny separately, the canny components for the createFastLineDetector should be nulled. This can be simply done by applying '0' to _canny_aperture_size. The other canny parameters can have any positive integer as it would ultimately not affect the function.
See the JNs for examples on his these are applied [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1U5mALmj5rIvw-5iQEtOwAOP6eC754IiR?usp=sharing).
* Developed a pipeline for adjusting parameters for line detection of images:
    (1) Organize images by similarities in color (by eye) and by color labels. 
    (2) For each folder containing images:
        (1) Choose one representative image.
        (2) Run the canny trackbar method to determine canny parameters.
        (3) Assume the parameters for blurring as (1,1) and the iterations for dilation and erosion as 1.
        (4) Run the line detection program. Redo step 3 by adjusting each of the parameters. Repeat until lines are detected. 
* Lines were detected for dimgray, royalblue, and steelblue images. The JNs and sample results can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1U5mALmj5rIvw-5iQEtOwAOP6eC754IiR?usp=sharing).
* Created and finished presentation of results for Thursday, which can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-oNN3Vg3TZgLzT34YXynW1c1hrGq4ccf?usp=sharing).

To Do:
* Continue studying and working on OpenCV tutorials and project.

* Meeting with larger CV Group. Discussed progress for this week.
* Completed the JNs for the remaining colors: gray, darkslateblue, and slategray. The JNs can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-oNN3Vg3TZgLzT34YXynW1c1hrGq4ccf?usp=sharing). Images containing 'no snow' and images taken at 'night' will have their own respective programs which will be developed later. 
* All JNs are capable of detecting lines for most images in their respective colors. There are weaknesses:
    (1) Inclement Weather: When there is heavy precipiation (i.e. snow), the poles are not as visible and the thus the lines cannot be detected.
    (2) Not enough snow/Patches on the ground: Sometimes there are patches in the snow which adds more noise in the image. 
    (3) Shadows: Shadows from nearby buildings and structures change the dominant color labels for the ROIs. Most of the time, it makes the poles not visible for the line detector to detect. 
    (4) Images with different weather containing similar color labels.
* There are in total 8 labels: dimgray, royalblue, steelblue, gray, darkslateblue, slategray, no snow, and night. 
* Attended 'Office Hours' session with Sean on Plugin Development.

To Do:
* Continue studying and working on OpenCV tutorials and project.

### July 9, 2021 (Day 28)
Updates:
* Developed initial program for classifying images using Sci-kit Learn ML models. 
* There were prerequisites that need to be done first.
    (1) Created labels for the images in the dataset based on the log from yesterday. The new dataset can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1j2gwzKOHwOaJ_uzTDHpv18HLCM21Ub_C?usp=sharing).
    (2) Label encode data.
* Create PowerPoint for Midpoint presentation on Monday.

To Do:
* Continue studying and working on OpenCV tutorials and project.
