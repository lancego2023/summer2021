## Week 3 ##
    
###  6/14/2021 ###
* Practiced Presentation
* Attended meeting where I learned about other projects and gave presentation on my project
* Understand the canny edge detection threshold thing and understand canny edge detection
* Update presentation for what I understand so far
* Researched and calculated Entropy. Need to research more on finding the best way to do so.
    * There should be an easy function call for it, cant find it?
* GOAL for end of week:
    * Be completely done computing features
    * Have a good grasp on how to use Support Vector Machines
    
### 6/15/2021 ###
* Attended meeting with CV team
* Used Hough Line Transform to detect straight edges and compute straight edge density.
    * Am running into issues about finding the best threshold values to use in order to 
      detect all the straight lines
* Wrote a couple of test cases for straight edge density computation
* Wrote test cases for entropy -> Need to debug find_entropy function

### 6/16/2021 ###
* Attended seminar on "Overcoming Imposter Syndrome"
* Accurately calculated entropy that passed test cases
* Computed vertical reflectional symmetry of image
* Wrote test cases for vertical reflectional symmetry of image
* Strengthened Hough Line Transform by using bilateralFilter which blurs the image while keeping
    edges sharp. Was able to more accurately compute the straight edge density this way
  
### 6/17/2021 ###
* Attended meeting with CV team
* Attended student connect meeting
* Instead of using Hough, changed my code to use opencv's Line Segment Detector in order to
    compute straight edge density because this more accurately finds straight edges and 
    runs much faster.
* Computed total length of all line segments combined in order to compute the straight edge density
* Watched videos on vector support machines

### 6/18/2021 ###
* Watched videos on machine learning and different machinen learning models
* I am a little confused on what machine learning algorithm to use and how to go about the second part of the project

## Week 4 ##

### 6/21/2021 ###
* Attended zoom meeting where I learned about other projects 
* Prepared slides for mid - point progress presentation on parts of the project that I have 
  already completed
* Researched and understood the math behind canny edge detection through Udacity computer vision videos
* Wrote additional test cases 
* Need to get started on second part of project, came up with a couple of questions to ask in tomorrows meeting
  about that
  
### 6/22/2021 ###
* Attended meeting with computer vision team
* Researched random forests machine learning model to use in project
* Fixed an issue with straight line detection

### 6/23/2021 ###
* Attended zoom meeting on "Connecting to a Career through Linkedln"
* Watched a couple more videos on random forests and decision trees.
* Wrote a simple program using random forests involving classifying different
  types of flowers in order to get a better grasp on random forests for project.
* Recieved images for data in project.

### 6/24/2021 ###
* Attended meeting with computer vision team 
* Attended student connect meeting           
* Attended Seans meeting on plugins
* Wrote random forest model using data given
    * Need to confirm if I am using the data correctly
    
### 6/25/2021 ###
* Finish Random Forest Tree Classifier
* Accuracy low, so researched on ways to improve accuracy of model
* Ask if I should be using computed features already in data given
  or if I should use features I computed
* TODO:
  * Need to use this to find out which faetures matter the most 
        towards visual disorder and which features matter the least
  * Still need to find out ways to improve accuracy for model

## Week 5 ##

### 6/28/2021 ###
* Need to ask: there were some images that were not urban, do I remove them from dataset
* Used images given to compute features and create own dataframe with my computed features
    and used this in random forest classifier --> still need to clarify if I am using my computed features
    or the ones given
* Spent most of the time debugging why some images were running into errors when trying to compute features
  I am still working on fixing some of those errors so that I can use my computed features in random forest 
* Need to work on fixing accuracy of random forest, will check what accuracy is after using my own features too.
  * Should check that training images have some from each classifications
    
### 6/29/2021 ###
* Attended meeting with CV team
* created new dataframe to input features
* Replaced classifications to 3 different groups instead of 7, so I can start off small
* Tried to compute features of all images --> was taking a long time
  Therefore in the meanwhile I prepared more slides for the next presentation.
* Ran into errors when computing straight edge density for some of the training images
  Working on debugging errors
* Ran into errors with some files not existing as images that I can use to compute features. 
* After computing all features plan on normalizing the data, then computing features again
so that they are normalized.

### 6/30/2021 ###
* Attended meeting 9 - 10 am
* Still running into bugs when creating dataframe with computed features
    * standard deviation of hue, saturation, and value show up as 0 on saved excel file 
      with data even though when testing and printing out the standard deviation, it prints not 0.
      All other features are put into the dataframe correctly.
    * After lots of debugging found out the issue was that when I call the function to compute mean hsv
      I change the values of hsv image which is then used in function for computing standard deviation
      of image as well
* Debugged the issue about when I tried to save all features into excel file again ran into a permission denied issue
* Changed the way that I saving my dataframe into excel file so that it doesnt all save at once at the very
  end but instead saves every couple of images so that if I run into an error again I do not need to start all over
* Mean hue is also showing up as different 
    * debugged it by using cv2.imread instead of io.imread
* Debugged the issue that rows with files that did not have images correlated with them were not being
  deleted from dataframe
* Was able to achieve a 63 percent accuracy, I am still working on getting accuracy higher

### 7/1/2021 ###
* Attended meeting with CV team
* Attended student connect meeting
* normalized all data, however accuracy stayed the same
* Made sure that I have an even number of samples in each classification
  * Was a little confused about this because when I made the number of samples more
    even from each classification, it accuracy went down
* Try changing straight edge density and edge density computations
* Found out that when I delete Mean Value, standard deviation of saturation and
  standard deviation of value features, accuracy increases. When I delete edge
  density and entropy accuracy does not change at all... so I probably need to check
  those calculations.
