Hello world

### Monday, June 14: 
   - Finished my orientation 
   - Met my mentor, Neal Conrad
   - Got information on what my task was, started to look into React.js, JSON, and other javascript libraries 

### Tuesday, June 15: 
   - Met with my mentor again and researched more about my heat maps and the UI. Looked at the Neon website for inspiration and thought about how I could. . 
   - improve it for Sage 
   - Did more research on heat maps and what functions 
   
### Wednesday, June 16: 
   - Watched Youtube Videos to try and gain a better understanding of JSON, terminal, and InfluxDB 
   - My knowledge of terminal and JSON improved
   - went through the Sage data and tested some functions for influxDB

### Thursday, June 17: 
   - Finished some paperwork for new hires 
   - Met with my mentor to discuss what I should try to focus my next research on 
   - Finished my slide and worked on my week 1 summary and presentation for Monday
   
### Friday, June 18: 
   - Started a doc that had what I learned from influxDB
   - Started learning about React.js and d3.js 
   
### Monday, June 21: 
   - Gave my presentation 
   - Got good feedback
      - consider the question, what happens with the data during night, when the sensors aren't gathering information (like how should the UI be formatted to accomdate for that)
      
### Tuesday, June 22: 
   - Started coding
   - Looked at examples of heatmaps that are well done and have been trying to replicate
   - I have been working with other sample data instead of Sage data because it is a little difficult to access it
   
### Wednedsay, June 23: 
   - Same as Tuesday: I have just been trying to replicate the heat maps 
   
### Thursday, June 24: 
   - Attending Sean's tutorial on how to grab Sage data
   - Again, worked on the UI on the heat map
   
### Friday, June 25:
  - UI with the heat map and the code that aggregates the data
  
  
### Monday, June 28: 
  - Finished some TMS training and paperwork
  - Looked into possible websites that the redesigned Sage website could possibly look like 
  - (Had a flight to catch)

### Tuesday, June 29: 
  - Met with Neal and he taught me easier ways to run Visual Studio Code
  - Downloaded an http-server and practiced with it
  - The data from the heat table wasn't displaying beforehand, but it does now with the http-server
  
### Wednesday, June 30: 
   - Learned about Markdown and changed my file to dailylog.md
   - Compiled a list of websites and put them in a doc, then put the best qualities about the websites and.. . 
   -. . . what Sage could take from it 
   
### Thursday, July 1: 

   - Started to read this novel "Don't make me Think" to help me with how the code works for data viz 
   - Had a meeting with Neal, got redirected for my next few days at work
   - Found out I need to practice more with Unix commands and opening files with the terminal 
   
### Friday, July 2: 

   - Watched tutorial on Unix and got familar with basic commands (ls, cd, rm, etc, etc)
   - Created my own shortcut on the terminal to Github because I have been opening my files the inefficient way
   - Also played around on Github more because I lack experience with it
