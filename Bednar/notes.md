Overlapping the ceilometer and optical flow velocity vectors needs to be calculated.
Ceilometer data interval is 16 seconds with 5400 data points, one whole day of data. 
Optical Flow is every 30 seconds with around 11 hours of data. 13:18:30 to 23:12:30, 1188 frames
Need to grab ceilometer data from the start of the movie and skip 1 data point.
