## Notes

- Will build a Jenkins pipeline that can launch a Jenkins docker container on the NX that holds the profiling Python script which it will then execute
  - A dockerfile is necessary to build the jenkins agent container
    - The ADD command can be used to add files to the image at a particular destination (this can be relative to WORKDIR or an absolute path): `ADD [--chown=<user>:<group>] <src>... <dest>`
  - The Jenkinsfile is contained within a `config.xml` file which resides in `/var/lib/jenkins/jobs/nvidia-nx-profiling-pipeline`
  - Running into a permissions error where the Jenkins agent cannot access the Docker socket because it does not run with sudo permissions
    - Fixed by giving jenkins-agent ownership of /run/docker.sock
  - I am able to execute a working pipeline that launches a Docker container of the plugin-base on the Jenkins agent, transfers the Python profiling script I have written using stash/unstash, and runs it. The problem I now have is that I need to install all the script's python dependencies on the Jenkins docker image, since they are not included with plugin-base.
    - My solution is to write up a Dockerfile for an all-inclusive profiler image that will contain my profiling script and the app's docker image within it. Jenkins will build the docker image on my desktop, then copy it to the NX, which it will then run.
