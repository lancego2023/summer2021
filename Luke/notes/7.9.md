## Notes

- Looking through Chris's Tau wrapper code so that I can integrate his configuration with my script
  - Why run two containers when one can do the trick? I can use Jenkins to launch the profiling container which will contain the wrapper script, and it will manage the app's execution, and it will make sure to start nvprof and Tau if specified to run. It can launch all the apps in the background using bash. The output of each will be piped into their respective profiling logs. I will get to work on a bash file which will manage the processes.
- Bash scripting notes
  - In bash make sure to put double quotes around an array to evaluate it as a space-separated list
  - Use the `-o` flag in ps to change the format of the process output
  - Was able to write a script that sends an interrupt to nvprof if it is running, and waits till it finishes
