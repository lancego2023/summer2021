## Notes

- Working with `exec_run` to find a way to launch nvprof before the app so that it can attach to it as it runs. I need to collect the metrics it outputs after it completes, so I could have stdout direct into a file or retrieve stdout through a generator stream. Now it looks like retrieving a file is the best move.
- Trying to retrieve the stdout of the Python script that will be run. I am stuck on getting the output piped into a file. I have been able to run nvprof in the container from the start, but starting the app process and then killing it is harder. I am sort of operating blindly because I can't get much output from processes running in the container.
