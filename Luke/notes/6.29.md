## Tasks Completed

- ECR Meeting

## Notes

- Because containers are a Sage standard for running programs on any machine, I will try to configure my Python profiling script to run in a container. This means that all the external tools that the script runs (tegrastats, nvprof) will need to be given access to the hardware. This may require some work on Docker configurations (maybe cgroup work?).
  - How can we get tegrastats to work in a container?
    - Can just set up a volume to the executable
  - How can nvprof work in a container?
    - Same as tegrastats
  - If I give a container access to an executable on the filesystem of the host and I have the container execute that program, is it really containerized? To put it differently, do we need to package tegrastats and nvidia tools with the profiling container? (Or can we just use the host's executable?)
- My goal now is to provide some sort of demo for tomorrow's metrics meeting- I will try to get my Python script to work
  - I am able to spawn a few processes and write their outputs to files, but I am not able to kill any of them. It might have something to do with process groups and that the signal is not propagating through the shells.
  - I have setup a local Git repo for my script so that I can track my changes.
