## Tasks Completed

- Watched presentation "You and Your Research" by Hamming
- Configured the playback server to play a video to the objcounter

## Notes

- Learning about Unix socket usage in Python *(Resource: https://pymotw.com/2/socket/uds.html)*

  - Unix sockets are just files and treated like network sockets, so I can use the `socket` module with them just like I have written client-servers in the past

- Metric Collection Architecture

  - The plugin that is running in the Docker container will be able to talk to the host which will be running the ECR profiler. One reason to have the profiler running on the host is that it can grab custom metrics (metrics not being explicitly logged by the developers like GPU metrics).
  - Plugin-computed metrics (metrics that developers have written into their code to be computed, like FPS) will be gathered by the profiler over Unix socket

- Profiler script design notes

  ```
  Use cases
  --------------------
  1. Simulated profiling. This mode of profiling is entirely directed by the developer. They supply a sample dataset and target arguments to run their app. The profiler runs their app with the given instructions and records metrics with timestamps and writes them to an output file. This process is automated by Jenkins, so Jenkins retrieves this output file and returns the metrics with their corresponding timestamps and places them into a database.
  2. Live profiling (I am not sure how this will be implemented so I won't worry too much about this.)
  
  Simulated profiling loop
  ------------------------
  - Gather system metrics and combine with the current timestamp
    - Use the pycuda.driver.mem_get_info() call to get the new GPU memory allocated by the app
    - Use tegrastats to get GPU/CPU temperatures and simple overview memory usage
    - Run Tau
  - Gather custom metrics via socket
  - Write all metrics to file
  
  Design Considerations
  ------------------------
  - Some apps will require the use of the waggle-playback server. Some problems arise from this. How will the developers specify this in the YAML? How can we automate this within the Python profiler script?
  ```

- My goal for today is to create a simple profiler that can run from a Docker image name and a YAML file

  - YAML profiling format:

    ```
    name: objcounter
    namespace: waggle
    version: "0.0.0"
    description: "Object Counter"
    source:
        architectures:
            - linux/arm64
        url: https://github.com/waggle-sensor/plugin-objectcounter.git
    inputs:
        - id: interval
          type: int
    metadata:
      ontology: env.counter
    testing:
      command: [test.py]
    profiling:  # This is an example of how we would write YAML for the profiler
      targets:  # These are example run configurations (just arguments)
        - {args: "-interval 1 --use-gpu", timeout: 120}  # This is one config
        - {args: "--use-gpu", timeout: 60}  # This might be a more performance-intense config
        - {args: "--use-cpu", timeout: 0}  # This might be a config that only uses CPU and has no timeout (it relies on the app to close on its own)
      metrics: ['system', 'gpu-summary']  # This is where the developer specifies which external metrics to gather
    ```

    - Not stored in sage.yml, but database- the profiling depends on the user (so not hardcoded)
    - Should we allow the developers to specify docker arguments with their apps? (Probably not)
    

- Meeting Notes

  - Is a singular Python script as our profiler a good framework? I am thinking that Jenkins can invoke the script, wait for it to finish, and then collect its output (either stdout or written file)
  - How to deal with apps that require a playback server configuration or other app dependencies? Should we find a way for the developers to specify that in the YAML? 

- "You and Your Research"
  - You should have confidence that you will do something great
  - Pursue excellence and ideas that will grow to be big ideas
  - Study with great people
  - Open door theory- be receptive to new ideas
  - What appears to be a defect becomes an asset
    - Often there are bigger problems at play than what you are working on
    - Change the nature of the problem and realize the "real" problem
  - Study successes
  - Friday afternoon deep thoughts
    - An uninterrupted time to ask the nature of what you are doing
    - Try to predict the fundamentals
  - Tolerate ambiguity (don't be certain everything is correct)
  - Without change you will not have progress
  - Add hooks to your ideas
  - Style is everything
  - You need to attack the right problem at the right time with the right method
