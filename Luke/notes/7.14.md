## Notes

- Finishing up the pipeline glue logic

- The whole pipeline as I understand it today:

  - The Jenkins server has access to the build of the app, which it then uses to build the profiler image on top of the app. It then pushes that image to its local registry.
  - The NX pulls the profiling image and executes it.
  - The Jenkins pipeline still runs after the profiling image is complete and retrieves the un-processed metrics.

- I was able to write a Dockerfile such that the user can specify an app from the command line to build from, and docker will build the profiling tool suite on top of that layer.

  - ```
    # ===== MULTISTAGE BUILD OF SAGE PROFILER =====
    ARG APP_NAME
    FROM chrispkraemer/tauprofiler:0.0.0 AS builder
    
    # This image is the base
    #FROM waggle/plugin-objcounter:0.0.0
    FROM $APP_NAME
    
    # ===== COPY OVER TAU INSTALL =====
    COPY --from=builder /tau /tau
    COPY --from=builder /usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/pylib /usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/pylib
    ENV PATH="/tau/tau-2.30.1/arm64_linux/bin:$PATH"
    ENV PYTHONPATH=/tau/tau-2.30.1/arm64_linux/lib/bindings-python
    
    # ===== INSTALL TEGRASTATS BINARY =====
    COPY tegrastats /usr/bin/tegrastats
    WORKDIR /app
    COPY tauprofiler.sh .
    
    # ===== SETUP PROFILING SCRIPT =====
    COPY --from=builder /tau/wrappertest.py /app/wrappertest.py
    ENTRYPOINT ["./tauprofiler.sh"]
    
    ```

-  I was also able to write a Jenkinsfile which tells Jenkins to build the profiling agent on the server, push it to the local docker registry, then commands the NX to pull the profiling-agent image. At the moment I need to learn how to trigger a Jenkins build with arguments, because the profiling-agent needs to receive a bunch of parameters (all the app arguments plus its own arguments).

  - ```
    node('master') {
        dir ('/home/luke/argonne2021_data/profiling_pipeline') {
            docker.withRegistry('https://localhost:5000') {
                def server_container_build = docker.build('profiling-agent')
                server_container_build.push('latest')
            }
        }
        
    }
    
    node('nvidia-nx') {
        /* Requires the Docker Pipeline plugin to be installed */
        docker.withRegistry('https://169.254.117.38:5000') {  // Pull from my desktop
            def profiler_agent = docker.image('profiling-agent')
            profiler_agent.pull()
            profiler_agent.run('-v profile_output:/app/profile_output --runtime nvidia --network host')
            echo "The Docker container has finished"
        }
    }
    
    node('master') {
        dir ('/home/luke/argonne2021_data/profiling_pipeline/output') {
            unstash name: 'metrics'
        }
    }
    ```
