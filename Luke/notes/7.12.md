## Notes

- It appears that everything that I have been doing in Python with the pipeline can be done in bash equally well (if not better), so I am going to switch over to a bash implementation of the pipeline.

- I brought up the idea to Chris and Yongo about having a profiler docker layer that would be built on top of the app or on top of plugin-base. I would think it would make more sense to build on top of the app, because if we built on top of plugin-base, then we couldn't use the built image from the Jenkins server since there would be a new layer between plugin-base and the app. The app would need to be re-compiled, this time with a new base.

  ```

  |    [ App ]                  [ Profiler ]
  |    [ Profiler ]       vs.   [ App ]
  |    [ Plugin-base ]          [ Plugin-base ]
  ```
