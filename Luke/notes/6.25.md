## Tasks Completed

- Met with Sean
- Set up a simple custom Prometheus metric in Python *(Resource: https://github.com/prometheus/client_python)*

## Notes

- Implementing a Python script that will take the necessary plugin profiling inputs, perform the profiling, and output the result to a text file for upload back to the Jenkins server

  - Necessary inputs *(Will the testbed be given the full repo of the Docker image or the image itself? How will the testbed communicate with the Jenkins server through this Python file?)*
    - Assume right now it will be given a repo URL
    - It could also be given `sage.yaml` + Docker image w/ preprogrammed entrypoint

- **Meeting Notes**

  - Adding hooks

    - We could create a branch from the standard pywaggle repo and add performance hooks to that code
    - When the profiling script is running, it could somehow activate the hooks and configure them to output intermittent metrics to a file that would be collected by Jenkins (so that they can be put in a database)
    - It would also be helpful if we could capture these metrics in real time (Prometheus is an option) so that Aji's scheduler/feedback controller can "turn knobs" on performance parameters

  - Fastd controller

  - There will be an interface between the plugin and the fastd controller / monitor like a TCP/Unix socket

  - My implementation work seems to be shifting more towards interprocess communication

  - Diagrams from meeting

    ```

    ```
    from waggle import plugin
    # ~ FAST measure?
    # fps = plugin.metric("fps")
    # fps = plugin.metrics.fps()
    fps = plugin.metric("fps")
    acc = plugin.metric("acc")
    # ~ FAST knobs
    res = plugin.param("res")
    while True:
        res.get()
        ... get image ..
        ... process frame ...
        ... publish ...
        fps.inc()
    ```

  - I should look into resources on Unix sockets and how to incorporate them into Python

  - It may be helpful to research scheduling for personal interest and application in the future.

- Unix Sockets *(Resource: https://medium.com/swlh/getting-started-with-unix-domain-sockets-4472c0db4eb1)*

  - The data sent to a unix socket is managed by the kernel
